# Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts Disassembly
Disassembly of SGnG, based on the JP version of the game (initial release).

This is something I've done on and off over a long time.
The quality and style of various code and data sections can vary quite a bit as a result.

At some point it'd be fun to generate the US & EU roms as well.

## Instructions
Assemble `chou.asm` with asar. Produces an identical copy of the original rom.
